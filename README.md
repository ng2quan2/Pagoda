# Subject Project
# Pagoda Project

This is an application that has been programmed to help the abbot manage tasks and personnel within the temple more easily. The project will use C# and MS SQL as the programming language and database, respectively, and will use Bootstrap and jQuery for the user interface. The application is intended for two main user groups: the monk and the buddhist. The abbot will have full control over the system, while the Buddhist followers will only be able to update information and cannot delete any records. When downloading the source code, please note to modify the connection string in the web.config file along with other relevant information.
